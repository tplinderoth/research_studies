Some scripts in this directly are slightly modified from their versions on the HPCC in order to consolidate the same analyses run 
across multiple scripts using the same commands (e.g. for different groups). All of the exectuble commands are the same as their 
implementations in scripts on the HPCC and reflect exactly how the results were generated.
