Resources for the study "translocations spur population growth but exacerbate inbreeding 
in an imperiled species" by Linderoth *et al*.

### Code

Commands and code for the overarching analytical workflow are in [Linderoth_etal_Mosaic_FSJ_translocations_study_code.txt](./Linderoth_etal_Mosaic_FSJ_translocations_study_code.txt). 
Scripts and custom programs upon which the workflow depends are in [scripts](./scripts).

The relateStats program for calculating expected genetic contributions from pedigrees and the reproductive skew (*K*) statistic 
from genetic data is part of [PopGenomicsTools](https://github.com/tplinderoth/PopGenomicsTools).
